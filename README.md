# Algebraic_Nonlin_SFT
A Python implementation of an algebraic approach to investigate nonlinear suppression effects in the solar dynamo, inspired by the formulation in Wang et al. (2013). It simulates the buildup of the Sun's polar field through synthetic emergence of active regions (ARs), incorporating nonlinearities such as Tilt Quenching (TQ), Latitude Quenching (LQ)
